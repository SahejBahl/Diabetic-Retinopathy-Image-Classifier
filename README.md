# TurnerHacks - BlindSighted
A demo that can measure severities in levels of diabetic retinopathy in fundus pictures through machine learning. 
This is Blind-Sighted - A Diabetic Retinopathy Mobile Scanner. 

Demo Completed at Turner Hacks 24-Hour Hackathon.

For a first hackathon, the project was not perfect and lacks accuracy/efficiency.
